# TorsionNet Ramp-Up
Work on extending TorsionNet/AlphaFold will pull together a number of fields
in addition to requiring familiarity with the relevant papers. Here's a compilation

the relevant material, both for papers and corresponding background skills. The
recommended course is to go through the background tutorials first, before moving
onto the SOTA papers.
